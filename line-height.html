<h2>Air travel for brachycephalic breeds</h2>
<p class="small">
    
It is a challenge for snub nose cats and dogs to travel due to their increased risk of respiratory difficulties and heat intolerance during air travel. Cathay Cargo is a proud holder of the CEIV Live Animals certification and now accepts certain brachycephalic breeds for carriage from January to May and from October to December on the following routes*:

Hong Kong to London
Hong Kong to Melbourne
Hong Kong to Singapore
*The routes from London Heathrow to Hong Kong is temporarily unavailable for the carriage of brachycephalic breeds due to operation reasons until further notice.

When moving or travelling with brachycephalic animals, you are required to work with a pet travel agent who will ensure they meet all conditions of travel. Please contact any of the agents listed on the IPATA Pet ShippersOpen a new window page when arranging air travel for a brachycephalic pet.

<h2>Pet travel agents</h2>
<p class="big">
    Navigating complex pet travel requirements, and compliance and making the arrangements can be daunting. Pet travel agents can provide personalised assistance for a more seamless experience. We recommend selecting an agent who is a member of the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association (IPATA) or Animal Transport Association (ATA). This can help guarantee access to professionals who possess expertise in pet transportation, have a global network and prioritises advocacy for animal welfare.

If your pet is travelling from Hong Kong, you can book Cathay Live Animal through any agent. Learn about the steps to arranging pet travel from Hong KongOpen a new window and see a list of IPATA and ATA pet travel agents below.
