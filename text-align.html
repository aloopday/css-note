        <p class="main">To effectively walk your dog, ensure the weather is suitable, equip them with a comfortable collar and leash, and maintain control throughout the walk. Pay close attention to your dog's behavior and the surrounding environment, managing distractions by keeping the leash short and using positive reinforcement. Consider using a harness or headcollar for dogs that pull, and always be prepared with essentials like waste bags and treat</p>
